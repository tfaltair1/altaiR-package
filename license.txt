fees, arising from the indemnifying Party's breach, if any, of this
warranty.

10.2    LIMITED WARRANTY. Supplier warrants that it shall take reasonable
commercial efforts to ensure that the Software, in the form and when
provided to Customer, is free of viruses, malware or other harmful
code.

10.3    SUPPLIER EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS AND OTHER
TERMS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE
OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, INFORMATIONAL CONTENT OR
ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, ERROR-FREE
OPERATION, WITH REGARD TO THE SOFTWARE, AND THE PROVISION OF OR FAILURE
TO PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES. SUPPLIER DOES NOT WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE
OR RESULTS CUSTOMER MAY OBTAIN BY USING THE SOFTWARE NOR THAT THE
SOFTWARE IS ERROR-FREE.

10.4    CUSTOMER AGREES THAT IT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUITABILITY
OF THE SOFTWARE AND ANY DATA GENERATED OR PROCESSED BY THE SOFTWARE FOR
CUSTOMER'S OR CUSTOMER'S AFFILIATES' INTENDED USE, AND CUSTOMER WILL

=============================================================================
11. Intellectual Property Indemnity
=============================================================================

11.1    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
Supplier undertakes at its own expense to defend Customer or, at
Supplier's option and in Supplier's absolute discretion, settle any
claim or action brought against Customer by a third party alleging that
Customer's possession or use of the Software (or any part thereof) in
accordance with this Agreement infringes that third party's intellectual
property rights (CLAIM) and Supplier shall be responsible for any
reasonable direct losses, damages and costs (including reasonable legal
fees incurred by legal advisors appointed or approved by Supplier) incurred
by or awarded against Customer as a result of or in connection with any
such Claim. Supplier's indemnification obligations in this section are
conditional on Customer:



        (a)     as soon as reasonably practicable, giving written notice
of the Claim to Supplier, specifying the nature of the Claim in reasonable
detail;

        (b)     not making any admission of liability, agreement or
compromise in relation to the Claim without Supplier's prior written
consent;

        (c)     not incurring any legal expenses in respect of the Claim
without Supplier's prior written approval;

        (d)     allowing Supplier to, in its absolute discretion, assume
conduct and control of any proceedings related to the Claim and to
defend, avoid or compromise the Claim in whatever way Supplier sees fit
with its own choice of legal advisers. Customer may, at Customer's sole
expense, appoint additional legal advisers but Supplier shall have no
obligation to indemnify Customer in respect of any fees or expenses
incurred by such legal advisers;

        (e)     giving Supplier and its professional advisers access at
reasonable times (on reasonable prior notice) to Customer's premises,
officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives or advisers, and
to any relevant assets, accounts, documents and records within Customer's
possession, custody or control so as to enable Supplier and its professional
advisers to examine them and to take copies (at Supplier's expense) for
the purpose of assessing and/or defending the Claim; and

        (f)      taking such action Supplier may reasonably request to
avoid, dispute, compromise or defend the Claim.

11.2    If any Claim is made, or in Supplier's opinion is likely to be
made, against Customer, Supplier may at its sole election (in so far as
is permitted under applicable law) and expense:



        (a)     procure for Customer the right to continue to use the
Software (or any part thereof) in accordance with this Agreement and
Customer's applicable Licence; or

        (b)     modify, repair or replace the Software with functionally
equivalent non-infringing software if Supplier determines in Supplier's
discretion that it is feasible to do so. Insofar as applicable law
permits, Supplier shall have no other liability to Customer except as
otherwise expressly provided in this section;

        (c)     if Supplier modifies, repairs or replaces the Software,
the modification, repair or replacement shall comply with the warranties
given in this Agreement;

        (d)     if Supplier determines in Supplier's discretion not to
modify, repair or replace the Software with a functionally-equivalent
non-infringing version, Supplier may terminate this Agreement and/or any
Licence immediately by written notice to Customer and shall refund any
remaining unused whole months of the Licence Fee paid by Customer for
the applicable Licence Period.

11.3    Without prejudice to any warranties and/or liabilities that are
binding under applicable law, this section constitutes Customer's
exclusive remedy and Supplier's only liability in respect of Claims and,
for the avoidance of doubt, is subject to section 13.4.

11.4    Any indemnities Supplier provides, and any obligation on
Supplier to modify, repair or replace the Software, shall not apply if
the Claim results, in whole or in part, from Customer's conduct or the
conduct of someone acting on Customer's behalf. In particular, but
without limitation, Supplier shall have no obligation or liability to
Customer if Customer or someone acting on Customer's behalf has altered,
modified or amended the Software in any way or used it otherwise than in
accordance with this Agreement or in combination with unsuitable or
poorly maintained software or hardware.


=============================================================================
12. Limitation of liability
=============================================================================

12.1    Customer acknowledges that the Software has not been developed
to meet any of Customer's individual requirements, and that it is
Customer's responsibility to ensure that the features and operational
capability of the Software, including any Updates or Upgrades, meet
Customer's requirements before Customer licenses or uses the Software
under this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that Customer has had the
opportunity to test and evaluate the Software prior to purchase.

12.2    The Software is not fault-tolerant and is not designed, manufactured
or intended for use with hazardous environments or high-risk activities
requiring a fail-safe performance. Customer agrees not to use the
Software in connection with activities in which the failure of the
Software could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or
environmental damage. Supplier and its licensors specifically disclaim
any express or implied warranty of fitness for high-risk activities.

12.3    IN THE EVENT THAT EITHER PARTY SEEKS TO CLAIM DAMAGES FROM THE
OTHER PARTY FOR ANY REASON OTHER THAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT,
THEY CAN RECOVER FROM THE OTHER PARTY ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE
AMOUNT CUSTOMER HAS PAID FOR THE RELEVANT LICENCE DURING THE CURRENT
LICENCE PERIOD.

12.4    NEITHER PARTY SHALL UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHATEVER BE LIABLE
TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
MISUSE OF THE SOFTWARE. SUCH OTHER DAMAGES MAY INCLUDE:

        (f)     ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PURE ECONOMIC
LOSS, DAMAGE, COSTS, CHARGES OR EXPENSES,



WHETHER OR NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF SUPPLIER HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT CUSTOMER MIGHT INCUR THAT LOSS OR TYPE
OF LOSS, OR IF REPAIR, REPLACEMENT OR A REFUND FOR THE SOFTWARE DOES NOT
FULLY COMPENSATE CUSTOMER FOR ANY LOSSES.

12.5    Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either Party's
liability for:



        (a)     intellectual property infringement;

        (b)     wilful or grossly negligent conduct;

        (c)     death or personal injury resulting from the other
Party's negligence;

        (d)     fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or

        (e)     any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited
by applicable law.


=============================================================================
13. Termination
=============================================================================

13.1    In the event that Customer commits a material or persistent
breach of this Agreement that Customer fails to remedy within thirty
(30) days after the service of a written notice requiring Customer to do
so, Supplier may, at its option and immediately upon written notice,
terminate this Agreement in its entirety (and all Licenses shall
terminate immediately) or terminate the Licence to which Customer's
breach relates. No refund of any Licence Fees shall be payable.

13.2    Supplier may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
notice to Customer if Customer: ceases, or threaten to cease, to trade,
or an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up of
Customer; an order is made for the appointment of an administrator to
manage Customer's affairs or documents are filed with a court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of an administrator or notice
of intention to appoint an administrator is given; a receiver is
appointed of any of Customer's assets or undertakings; if circumstances
arise which entitle a court of competent jurisdiction or a creditor to
appoint a receiver or manager of Customer; if another person takes
possession of or sells such of Customer's assets or Customer make any
arrangement or composition with Customer's creditors; if Customer makes
an application to a court of competent jurisdiction for the protection
of Customer's creditors in any way; in the event that there is a change
in Customer's control; or if Customer takes or suffers any similar or
analogous action to any of the foregoing in any jurisdiction in consequence
of debt. If Supplier is legally required to write to Customer's administrator
or equivalent insolvency practitioner to enquire whether they wish the
Agreement to continue, this Agreement shall only terminate if they do
not wish to continue the Agreement. No refund of any Licence Fees shall
be payable.

13.3    Either Party may terminate this Agreement for any reason or no
reason at all by giving the other Party sixty (60) days' written notice
and Customer may continue to use the Software for any Licences granted
under this Agreement until those Licences expire at which point this
Agreement shall terminate. If Customer terminates this Agreement then no
refund of any Licence Fees shall be payable.

shall cease;

        (b)     Customer must immediately cease all activities authorised
by this Agreement; and

immediately and permanently delete or destroy all copies of the Software

Customer or in Customer's possession or custody and certify to Supplier
that Customer has done so.


=============================================================================
14. Events outside Parties' control
=============================================================================

14.1    The Parties shall use reasonable endeavours to meet their
obligations under this Agreement despite any Events Outside the Parties'
Control. However, neither Party shall be liable or responsible for any
failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of its obligations
under this Agreement that is caused by an Event Outside that Party's
Control.

14.2    If an Event Outside a Party's Control takes place that affects
the performance of that Party's obligations under this Agreement the
Agreement will be suspended and the time for performance of those
obligations shall be extended until the Event Outside that Party's
Control ceases, but in any event no later than the expiry of the Licence
Period in which the Event Outside the Party's Control commences.


=============================================================================
15. Other important terms

Agreement to another organisation, but this shall not affect Customer's
rights or Supplier's obligations under this Agreement.

15.2    Customer may transfer its rights or obligations, or otherwise
deal with its rights, under this Agreement with Supplier's prior written
consent that may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Upon a change
of Control of Customer Supplier may terminate this Agreement without
notice unless the Supplier has agreed otherwise in writing, such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

15.3    This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the
Parties and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements,
promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings
between the Parties, whether written or oral, relating to its subject
matter. Customer agrees that it shall have no remedies in respect of any
statement, misstatement, representation, misrepresentation, assurance or
warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in
this Agreement. Customer agrees that it shall have no claim for innocent,
negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any
statement made to Customer prior to entering into this Agreement or

15.4    This Agreement shall apply to any use Customer makes of the
Software at any time. No terms in any documents or other correspondence

Quotation Request, Renewal Request, Purchase Order or terms of business,
shall apply.

15.5    Failure by either Party to demand the enforcement of any
obligations imposed on the other Party by this Agreement, or any delay
in doing so, shall not constitute a waiver of that obligation. A waiver
of any default by Supplier will only be effective if it is in writing
executed by one of Supplier's directors and will not constitute a waiver
of any subsequent default by Customer.

15.6    Each provision of this Agreement operates separately. If any
court or competent authority decides that any one of the provisions is
unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, but would be lawful, valid or
enforceable if some part of it were deleted or modified, the provision
in question shall apply with such deletion or modification as may be
necessary to make it lawful, valid or enforceable, and the remaining
conditions will remain in full force and effect.

15.7    Supplier may modify the terms of this Agreement, at Supplier's
sole discretion, providing that these modifications will not change the
duration of this Agreement nor the principal characteristics of what is
provided to Customer. Supplier shall notify Customer before Supplier
makes any changes to these terms, in one of the following ways:



        (a)     If Customer downloads or install a new version of the
Software, the terms included with the Software will replace these
terms.

        (b)     The license terms included within the Software are
available on Supplier's website worldprogramming.com.

        (c)     Supplier may email Customer.



Customer's continued installation and use of the Software after Supplier
provides notice of any amended terms constitutes Customer's acceptance
of the amended terms. In the event that Customer does not accept the
changes to these terms, Customer shall immediately cease to use the
Software provided to Customer under this Agreement, notify Supplier
accordingly, and this Agreement shall terminate immediately. Customer
shall be entitled to a refund of any unused portion of the Fees paid or
payable by Customer in respect of the Licence Period during which the
termination occurs.

15.8    This Agreement does not give rise to any rights under the
Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to enforce any term of this
Agreement.

15.9    Supplier may, at its option, refer to and use Customer's name
and/or Customer's trademark or logo in any customer list or logo sheet
included in Supplier's marketing materials.

15.10   If Customer provides Supplier with any feedback on the Software
or Supplier's products or services, Customer grants to Supplier and its
Affiliates and licensors the right to use such feedback to develop
services and products and to create and own derivative works based on
such feedback. Without limiting the foregoing, Supplier, its Affiliates
and its licensors may use information received from Customer to test,
develop, improve and enhance its products and services.

15.11   Any notice given by either Party under or in connection with
this Agreement shall be sent by email to the other Party's commercial or
legal contact previously notified to that Party. Any notice shall be
deemed to have been received at the time it is sent. This section does
not apply to the service of any proceedings or other documents in any
legal action.

15.12   The Parties agree that legal proceedings and associated documents
shall be validly served on the other Party if they are delivered by hand
to the registered office of the other Party.

15.13   If Customer is invoiced for the Licence Fees anywhere other than
in the United States, this Agreement, its subject matter and its
formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by
English law and the courts of England and Wales shall have exclusive
jurisdiction over all disputes, arguments and/or differences of opinion
between the Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement.

15.14   If Customer is invoiced for the Licence Fees in the United
States, this Agreement, its subject matter and its formation (and any
noncontractual disputes or claims) are governed by the laws of New York
and all disputes, arguments and/or differences of opinion between the
Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be
submitted to mandatory, final and binding arbitration before a single
arbitrator in New York in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
rules of the American Arbitration Association. The language of the
arbitration shall be English.

15.15   Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude Supplier's
right to enforce Supplier's rights in relation to Supplier's intellectual
property that subsists in any territory where the Software is used
(whether or not such use is authorised).

translation will be for reference purposes only, and only the English
version will be legally binding. If there is discrepancy between the
English text and the translated text, the English text will govern.
